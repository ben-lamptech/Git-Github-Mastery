**What is sudo?**

sudo stands for **"superuser do."** It temporarily elevates your privileges, allowing you to run commands as the root (admin) user.

# 1.2 Why It's Useful

    Install software: sudo apt install git

    Modify system files: sudo nano /etc/hosts

    Manage users and services: sudo useradd, sudo systemctl restart

You’ll often use sudo for setup and configuration tasks in Linux.

# 1.3 Why It’s Dangerous

    Root access means full control over your system.

    A typo (e.g., sudo rm -rf /) can wipe your entire OS without warning.

    Malicious scripts run with sudo can install backdoors or spyware.

# 1.4 Best Practices

    Only use sudo when necessary.

    Always read the full command before hitting Enter.

    Avoid copying unknown commands from the internet that require sudo.

## 1.5 Understanding `sudo`

    The `sudo` command stands for **"superuser do"**. It allows you to execute commands with elevated (administrator) privileges, which are often required for system-level tasks.
